A Data Scientist is a person who uses data to solve problems, uncover patterns and gain

1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
insight.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,199
They often work in businesses and organizations which gather and curate large data sets.

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,519
A data scientist may leverage knowledge from statistics, computer programming, databases,

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,359
machine learning and mathematical modeling to achieve their goals.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,800
A day in the life of a data scientist.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,399
First, the data scientist needs to understand the business or organizational issues.

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,120
Then they look for data.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,719
They may need to set up an experiment to acquire the data or the data may already exist somewhere

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,719
in.

10
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,519
If an experiment is required, it is important to write down the hypothesis before proceeding.

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:49,799
Once the data is gathered, it is checked and cleaned.

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,600
Then, the right tools for modeling are chosen.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,600
For example, R, Python or another software package.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,480
The data and results are then analyzed using visualization tools.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,359
The data scientist is looking for important insights and trends and checking their hypothesis.

16
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,040
Statistical tests are used to check the results robust and valid.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,879
The learnings, results and insights are communicated to the stakeholders, usually with recommendations.

18
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,439
For example, a data scientist working for a transport company might identify particular

19
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,000
routes that are inefficient and recommend solutions to them more efficient.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,519
With the advent of the data age, we can all now, with the help of data scientist, give

21
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,319
better insights and make better data driven decisions.
